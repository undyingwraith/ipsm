IPSM is a decentralized social media network built on top of IPFS.

All you need to join is a local IPFS node with api running on localhost port 5001.
After that all you need to do is visit here: https://k51qzi5uqu5dj00g8grr9pby14wibhuhkgxo7gdb5ebnlem2eaeob3809qni8p.ipns.dewb.link

*This is an IPFS url that you can open in your browser, but it requires IPFS to be installed on your machine to get access to the IPFS API.
